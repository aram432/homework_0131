Internet of Things is interconnected with safety devices in industrial scenes, such as mining, manufacturing or transport. 

Examples of IoT in worker safety includes "Smartcap" in Austrailia, which monitors brain activity of person operating heavy machinery like truck. Vandrico Solution in Canada has "connected worker system" that monitors worker's exposure to hazardous gases, and working on "smart helmet" to detect location of workers and prepare for emergency.  

As mentioned in the article, increase in worker safety not only adds to worker wellbeing, but lower insurance cost, risk, and liability of company. This could translates to larger investment as well. 


Useless IoT device: Sensoria fitness smart socks

Description (from the website) : 
	
I would not deny that these socks have certain merits (definitely features some rare functions); however, given that the price for these socks is $199, we might as well assess the benefits of these smart socks compared to the price. 
	
The main function of this socks seems to be health tracking: superior accuracy in step counting, speed, calories, altitude, distance tracking, cadence and foot landing technique. 
	
I see very little reason to spend $199 for marginally better accuracy than something like pedometer. The same goes for speed and calories; there is little reason that socks have to do the job - there are plenty of smart watch, smartphone application, health wristband that does the same or better. Even if I did want such information, altitude, cadence or foot landing technique are too much of an information that need to be "interpreted" to regular audience. 
	
These socks are not suitable for daily use as well. We normally do not wear the socks again before washing them - I would certainly be intimidated to "regularly" wash expensive socks that comes with Bluetooth. A "dedicated mobile application that monitors and guides you through real-time audio cues while you run" is certainly not for daily use when we commute everyday.
